## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need to do anything to prepare?

QHACK invitees span a variety of backgrounds, experiences, and skill levels. Everyone will be bringing unique perspectives and ideas to the event. We will begin the hackathon with a half-day session of exciting talks from big names in the field. These presentations will cover both introductory material and advanced ideas on quantum machine learning.

However, all participants are encouraged to spend some time familiarizing themselves with the basics of quantum computing, quantum machine learning, and the various quantum software platforms which will be used in the hackathon.

### How do I form a team?

Participants are encouraged to introduce themselves, discuss ideas, and begin to form up teams using the QHACK slack channel. We will also be having an (optional) social meetup the day before the hackathon begins. This is a great opportunity to meet people in person!

During the hackathon itself, we will have a dedicated period devoted to team forming. People will be able to introduce themselves, share what they can bring to a team, and pitch their ideas.

### What do I need to bring?

- Your creativity
- Ideas for hackathon projects
- A laptop

### What software should I install?

We hope to provide browser-based environments for hacking, but if you want to work on your own device, we recommend to install the following packages

- Python 3.6 or later

  If you currently do not have Python 3 installed, we recommend Anaconda for Python 3, a distributed version of Python packaged for scientific computation.
  
- Jupyter notebooks

- Pennylane from Xanadu

  `pip install pennylane`
  
- Qiskit from IBM

  `pip install qiskit pennylane-qiskit`
  
- pyQuil from Rigetti

  `pip install pyquil pennylane-forest`. To install the Forest SDK, see the instruction details provided by Rigetti.
