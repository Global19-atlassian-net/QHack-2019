## The Quick Version

Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable environment
and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of the following:

* gender
* gender identity and expression

* sexual orientation
* disability
* physical appearance
* body size
* race
* ethnicity
* nationality
* religion
* political views
* previous hackathon attendance or lack of
* computing experience or lack of
* chosen programming language or tech stack

We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language
and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, this includes the following:

* hacks
* talks, presentations, or demos
* workshops
* any parties associated to the hackathon
* social media
* any other online media

Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
the hackathon at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

* Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity
  and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
  race, ethnicity, nationality, religion or political views, sexual images in public
  spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video
  recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
  inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

* Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance
  to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph,
  comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where
  people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).

* Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

* As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our
  hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.

* Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
  sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor
  representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes,
  or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

* If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
  concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.

* Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law
  enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
  safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.

* If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any
  action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the
  hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.

* We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and
  hackathon-related social events.
